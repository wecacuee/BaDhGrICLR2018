In this work we show that state of art Deep reinforcement learning algorithms do not peroform long term mapping and or path planning.
We provide evidence that the algorithms are learning to perform bug exploration algorithm when the position of goal is random. When the position of goal and structure of map is known at training time, then the Deep reinforcement learning algorithms
are able to learn near optimal policy and able to repeat it at test time.
