% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands

%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have demonstrated progress in learning to find a goal in challenging environments.
  As the title of the paper by \cite{MiPaViICLR2017} suggests, one might assume that DRL based algorithms are able to ``learn to navigate'' and are thus ready to replace traditional mapping and path planning algorithms, at least in simulated environments.
  Yet, from experiments and analysis in this earlier work, it is not clear whether or not these DRL algorithms are indeed doing any form of mapping and path planning.
  In this paper, we pose and study this question: are DRL algorithms doing some form of mapping and/or path-planning?  Our experiments show that the algorithms are not memorizing the maps of mazes at the testing stage but, rather, at the training stage.
  Hence, the DRL algorithms fall short of qualifying as mapping and path-planning algorithms with any reasonable definition of mapping.
  We extend the experiments in \cite{MiPaViICLR2017} by separating the set of training and testing maps and by a more systemetic coverage of the space of experiment.
  Our experiments show that the \NavAiiiCDiDiiL{} algorithm when trained on tested on same maps is able to chose the shorter paths to the goal.
  However, when tested on unseen maps the algorithms utilize a pseudo-random bug exploration strategy to find the goal without doing an mapping or path planning.

  \caption{Plots showing the effect of number of training maps with random texture (Rnd Texture) and presence of apples (With apples), when evaluated on unseen maps. We note that although the difference between mean metrics is negligible as compared to standard deviation of the metrics. Hence we say that the effect of apples or textures can be ignored.
  The only clear trend is apparrent \LatencyOneGtOne{} metric which suggest that random texture along without apples is advantageous in exploiting goal location while finding the goal second time onwards.}
