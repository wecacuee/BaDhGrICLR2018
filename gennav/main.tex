% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have demonstrated strong progress in learning to reach a goal in challenging environments.
  As the title of the paper by \cite{MiPaViICLR2017} suggests, one might assume that DRL based algorithms are able to learn to navigate and is thus ready to replace traditional mapping and path planning algorithms.
  Yet, from experiments and analysis in this earlier work, it is not clear whether or not these DRL agents are indeed doing any form of mapping and path planning.
  In this paper, we pose and study this question: are DRL agents doing some form of mapping or path-planning?  Our experiments show that the agents are not memorizing the maps of mazes at the testing stage but, rather, at the training stage.
  Hence, the DRL algorithms fall short of qualifying as mapping and path-planning algorithms with any reasonable definition of mapping.
  We perform extensive experimentation on Nav-A3C-D-L algorithm proposed by
  \cite{MiPaViICLR2017} by

  \caption{Plots showing the effect of number of training maps with random texture (Rnd Texture) and presence of apples (With apples), when evaluated on unseen maps. We note that although the difference between mean metrics is negligible as compared to standard deviation of the metrics. Hence we say that the effect of apples or textures can be ignored.
  The only clear trend is apparrent \LatencyOneGtOne{} metric which suggest that random texture along without apples is advantageous in exploiting goal location while finding the goal second time onwards.}

\caption{Qualitative results when model trained on 1000 maps is
  evaluated on unseen simple maps.
  In this particular example, the agent takes the shortest path 6/10 times but when averaged over 100 episodes, the percentage of shortest path taken is reduced to $50.4$\% ($\pm 12.8$\%).
  Although for the example of wrench map the agent takes the shortest path 8/10 times but when averaged over 100 episodes, the percentage of shortest path taken is reduced to $32.9$\% ($\pm 25.1$\%).
 For the goal map, the example chosen here shows that the shortest path is only taken 1/6 times, on an average over 100 episodes, the shortest path is taken $42.6$\% ($\pm 35.1$\%) times.
