% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
  As shown in the paper, \cite{MiPaViICLR2017}, Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have demonstrated strong progress in learning to reach a goal in challenging environments. 
  Yet, from the experiments and analyses in this earlier work, it is not clear whether or not these DRL agents are performing any form of implicit mapping or path-planning in their navigation of these worlds.
  In this paper, we pose and study this question: are DRL agents performing some kind of implicit mapping or path-planning in their navigation?  Our experiments show that the agents are not memorizing the maps of mazes at the testing stage but, rather, at the training stage.
  Hence, the DRL agents fall short of qualifying as mapping and path-planning agents.
  We find evidence that the DRL agents are learning a correspondence to perform an action for each frame and there is no evidence of path-planning.

  \caption{Plots showing the effect of number of training maps with random texture (Rnd Texture) and presence of apples (With apples), when evaluated on unseen maps. We note that although the difference between mean metrics is negligible as compared to standard deviation of the metrics. Hence we say that the effect of apples or textures can be ignored.
  The only clear trend is apparrent \LatencyOneGtOne{} metric which suggest that random texture along without apples is advantageous in exploiting goal location while finding the goal second time onwards.}
