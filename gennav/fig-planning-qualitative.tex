\caption{Qualitative results when model trained on 1000 maps is
  evaluated on unseen simple maps.
  In this particular example, the agent takes the shortest path 6/10 times but when averaged over 100 episodes, the percentage of shortest path taken is reduced to $50.4$\% ($\pm 12.8$\%).
  Although for the example of wrench map the agent takes the shortest path 8/10 times but when averaged over 100 episodes, the percentage of shortest path taken is reduced to $32.9$\% ($\pm 25.1$\%).
 For the goal map, the example chosen here shows that the shortest path is only taken 1/6 times, on an average over 100 episodes, the shortest path is taken $42.6$\% ($\pm 35.1$\%) times.
